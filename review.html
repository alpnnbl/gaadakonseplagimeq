            <p>I don't watch many shonen saga anime, only mainstream shows like Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Fairy Tail, Hunter x Hunter, and do Samurai X and Fullmetal Aclchemist fall into that category? But all in all, I'm still not the least bit interested in watching Bleach. When it was broadcast on national TV when I was in elementary school, I enjoyed it. Then, since the private TV suddenly wasn't clear in setting the schedule, I wasn't interested anymore. After decades later, considering I have a lot of time right now, I then tried watching Bleach in a marathon. As a result, it's really torture watching this anime. I can firmly say that Bleach is the worst shonen saga anime I've ever watched, worse than Fairy Tail, even worse than Naruto's fillers.</p>
