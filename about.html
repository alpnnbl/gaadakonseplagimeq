                <h3>Plot Twist.</h3>
                <p>The storyline tells of the adventures of a stubborn teenager named Ichigo Kurosaki who inherits the destiny of his parents, after he gains the power of a Shinigami. "God of Death" refers to articles about Bleach characters, and "Shinigami" refers to articles about shinigami.</p>
                <p>a personification of death similar to the Angel of Death. From another Shinigami, Rukia Kuchiki, this new power forces Ichigo to take on the task of protecting humans from evil spirits and guiding the souls of the dead to the afterlife. Take him to adventures in various spiritual realms that exist.</p>
                <p>The "World of the Dead Spirits" a spiritual afterlife that is the place of origin and also for exterminating Hollows, stray souls similar to monsters that can attack spirits and humans. When Rukia is seriously injured while protecting Ichigo from the Hollow she is pursuing, Rukia gives her powers to Ichigo so he can take her place while Rukia recovers. Rukia is then trapped in an ordinary human body, and advises Ichigo who is trying to balance his duties as a substitute Shinigami while still attending school.</p>
                <p>In hunting down the Hollows, they both get help from a trio of teenagers who are also spiritually powerful: Ichigo's classmate Orihime Inoue, then his best friend Yasutora "Chad" Sado, and a Quincy, a human who can fight Hollows named Uryū Ishida. Later, Rukia was captured by her superior Shinigami and sentenced to death for committing the forbidden act of granting power to humans. Ichigo and his friends set off with the help of a scientist and former Shinigami named Kisuke Urahara,</p>
                <p>which also allows Ichigo to use his Shinigami powers, to enter Soul Society and save Rukia. Shortly after they arrived in Soul Society, conflict arose among the captains of the Gotei 13, when the captain of the 5th division Sōsuke Aizen was killed, resulting in the Shinigami starting to fight each other. However, just as Ichigo almost succeeds in saving Rukia and Soul Society from the threat of civil war, Aizen reappears and reveals his goal of obtaining the Hōgyoku (崩玉, "Crushed Ball"), a small orb with immense power that Urahara implanted in Rukia's human body.</p>
                <p>Aizen apparently faked his death and orchestrated Rukia's execution. Aizen is assisted by his co-conspirators, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen who are captains of the 3rd and 9th divisions, and they use the Hollows as a diversion to escape to the Hollow's spiritual realm, Hueco Mundo (虚圏 (ウェコムンド), trans. "Hollow World"). Later, Ichigo and Rukia return with the Shinigami, who view Ichigo as a strong ally and recognize him as the official replacement Shinigami.</p>
                <p>Ichigo and his friends then engage in a series of battles with Aizen's army of human-like Hollows, called Arrancar, while Ichigo and the others ally with Visored Shinigami who are victims of Aizen's experiments in creating hybrid Shinigami/Hollows. When one of Aizen's 10 strongest Arrancar Espada abducts Orihime, Ichigo and his friends enter Hueco Mundo to attack Aizen's castle. However, when Ichigo saves Orihime, Aizen reveals that his kidnapping was merely a distraction from his original plan to attack Karakura Town in order to sacrifice the souls of living humans to create the key to the Soul King Palace, so that he can kill the Spirit King that rules Soul Society.</p>
                <p>After the Visoreds join forces with the Shinigami to fight Aizen and his subordinates, Gin reveals his personal plan to kill Aizen. However, Aizen uses the Hōgyoku to transform into a Hollow-like figure and defeats everyone with ease. Ichigo ultimately manages to defeat Aizen at the risk of losing his powers and turning back into a human.</p>
                <p>Seventeen months later, while living his daily life and attending school, Ichigo is back in action when Xcution, a group of human Fullbringers endowed with supernatural powers similar to Chad's, manipulate him and those around him in their plan to awaken his Fullbring abilities. After his comrades from Soul Society restore his Shinigami powers, and learn that Ginjo Kugo the leader of Xcution is his predecessor and that a replacement Shinigami is not fully trusted, Ichigo defeats Ginjo and decides to continue fighting together with Soul Society.</p>
                <p>After Ichigo regains his powers, a group of Quincy soldiers known as the Wandenreich (見えざる帝国 (ヴァンデンライヒ), "The Invisible Empire") appear and declare war on Soul Society, after they enslave the Arrancar. The group is led by Yhwach, the ancient forerunner of the Quincy who seeks to kill the Spirit King and rid the world of the fear of death. In their first invasion, the Wandenreich killed many Shinigami including their chief captain, Yamamoto Genryusai.</p>
                <p>Uryū Ishida joins the Wandenreich as a means to approach Yhwach, who is responsible for his mother's death among other Quincy. Later, Ichigo and his friends assist Soul Society in resisting a second invasion by the Wandenreich, but Yhwach manages to kill the Spirit King. In the final battle, Yhwach returns to Soul Society to subdue it, but with the help of Uryū's father, Ichigo and Uryū manage to defeat the Quincy king.</p>
                <p>Years later, Rukia becomes the new captain of the 13th division and has a daughter, named Ichika from her marriage to her childhood friend, Renji Abarai. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who is also training to become a Shinigami.</p>
